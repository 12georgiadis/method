## Verbatim Cinema

On reconstruction from documents, and films that are neither true nor false.

---

Verbatim theatre takes real words -- transcripts, depositions, interviews, intercepted communications -- and puts them on stage exactly as they were spoken. No dramatization. No invented dialogue. The words are the material, and the material is real. What's constructed is everything else: the staging, the rhythm, the bodies, the space.

I'm interested in what happens when this approach meets cinema, and then what happens when it meets AI.

### The references

A few recent works define the territory:

**Reality** (Tina Satter, 2023). The entire film is built from the FBI transcript of Reality Winner's interrogation. Every word spoken on screen was actually spoken. The actors perform the transcript, including the redacted passages -- which appear as visual and sonic glitches, black bars over mouths, scrambled audio. The document's materiality becomes the film's form. What's classified becomes visible precisely as absence.

**Adolescence** (Netflix, 2025). Each episode unfolds in a single continuous take that follows institutional procedures in real time -- police work, school investigation, family therapy, legal process. The camera doesn't cut away. It stays with the procedure. The procedural framework *is* the dramaturgy. What makes it devastating is the refusal to dramatize: the system processes a child, and we watch the system work.

**David Fincher**. Across *Zodiac*, *The Social Network*, *Mindhunter*: obsessive reconstruction from documents. Fincher doesn't invent -- he compiles. Police reports, deposition transcripts, FBI interview techniques, typographic details of letters. The precision is not realism. It's a method of compression: reality is too chaotic to film directly, so you reconstruct it from its traces, and the reconstruction reveals patterns the lived experience couldn't see.

**The Zone of Interest** (Jonathan Glazer, 2023). The Holocaust filmed through its absence. The camera observes the Hoss family's domestic routine while the camp operates on the other side of the wall. The real is there -- in the sounds, the smoke, the architecture -- but never shown. Glazer reconstructed the house, placed hidden cameras, and let the actors live in the space. The document is the behavior. What's verbatim is not the words but the banality.

What these works share: they don't add fiction to reality. They don't subtract reality to make fiction. They reconstruct from real traces and let the reconstruction speak.

### The dataset as screenplay

My own practice extends this logic into the digital. For *The Goldberg Variations*, the starting material is a massive dataset: thousands of posts, messages, articles, court documents, social media traces left by Joshua Ryne Goldberg across dozens of fake identities -- ISIS recruiter, white supremacist, feminist blogger, GamerGate troll, Australian journalist. All real. All contradictory. All produced by the same person.

The first step is accumulation. AI tools parse, cross-reference, and organize the corpus. The dataset becomes navigable. Patterns emerge that no human researcher could find manually across this volume: linguistic tics shared between supposedly separate identities, timing patterns, escalation curves, the moments where the mask slips.

The second step is compression. From thousands of documents, extract the necessary. Not everything -- just what the film needs. The dataset is not the film. The dataset is the raw material from which the film's architecture is derived. This is comparable to what Fincher does with police files, but at a scale that requires computational tools.

The third step is reconstruction. And here is where AI changes the verbatim equation.

### Neither true nor false

Traditional verbatim cinema has a clear claim: these words were really spoken, this event really happened, we're showing you how. The truth claim is the foundation.

But what happens when you feed verbatim material through generative AI? When you take real transcripts and real images and process them through models that reconfigure, alter, hybridize?

The output is neither documentary nor fiction. It's not true in the way a transcript is true -- the AI has transformed it. It's not false in the way fiction is false -- every element originates in something real. It occupies a third space that doesn't have a good name yet.

This third space is where I work.

When a diffusion model generates an image from a real photograph of a real person, the result contains traces of the original -- but also traces of everything else in the model's training data. The generated image is a chimera: part document, part statistical average of human visual production. It's simultaneously specific (this person, this place, this moment) and generic (every similar person, place, moment the model has ever seen).

For a subject like Goldberg -- someone who was already multiple people, already performing contradictory identities, already blurring the line between real and fabricated -- this chimeric quality is not a distortion of the truth. It's the most accurate representation of it. The multiplication inherent in generative AI mirrors the multiplication inherent in the subject. (This is the [hybridization of the real](ecritures-liquides.md) at its most literal.)

### Reconstruction, not representation

The verbatim approach, pushed through AI, produces something I think of as reconstruction rather than representation.

Representation claims to show you what something looked like. Reconstruction shows you the process by which something is assembled from its traces. The difference matters.

In traditional documentary, the image says: "this happened, I was there, the camera recorded it." In verbatim cinema, the image says: "these words were spoken, we're performing them for you." In AI-reconfigured verbatim, the image says: "this material existed, it passed through a system, and what you're seeing is the result of that passage."

The honesty is in the process, not in the image. The image itself may be hallucinatory, chimeric, impossible. But its origin in real material, and the visibility of the transformation it underwent, is what makes it something other than fiction.

This is why the procedural dimension matters so much. *Adolescence* follows the procedure. Fincher reconstructs the procedure. Glazer reveals the procedure by refusing to show what the procedure produces. In each case, the process is more truthful than any single image could be.

AI adds a new kind of procedure: the computational transformation of real material into synthetic images that retain traces of their origin. Making this procedure visible -- not hiding the AI, not pretending the images are "real" -- is the ethical and aesthetic condition for this kind of work.

### What verbatim cinema is not

It shares territory with re-enactment but differs in one key respect. Re-enactment imagines how events might have unfolded -- it fills gaps, invents dialogue, dramatizes. Verbatim cinema stays anchored to the source text. *Reality* is re-enacted in the sense that actors perform a scene, but every word comes from a real transcript. The performance is constructed; the language is not. The distinction is about the relationship to the source material, not about whether actors are involved.

It's not docufiction. Docufiction invents fictional elements and places them alongside documentary ones. Verbatim cinema doesn't invent -- it transforms. The material is entirely real. The treatment is entirely constructed.

It's not deepfake. Deepfakes aim to deceive -- to produce images that pass as unaltered recordings. Verbatim cinema with AI aims to reveal -- to show what happens when real material meets computational transformation. The goal is not to fool anyone. The goal is to make visible a process that produces something neither true nor false, but real in a different way.
