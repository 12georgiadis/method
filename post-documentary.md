## Post-Documentary

On what happens to the real when AI enters documentary practice.

---

Documentary cinema has always been a negotiation with the real. It was never a transparent window -- the camera chooses a frame, the editor chooses a cut, the filmmaker chooses a subject. But for most of its history, documentary maintained one fundamental claim: something was there, in front of the lens, and the camera recorded it. The indexical bond between image and reality was the contract.

Generative AI breaks that contract. And that's where the interesting work begins.

### The indexical question

André Bazin argued that the photograph's power comes from its automatic genesis -- the world imprints itself on the film through light, without human intervention at the crucial moment of capture. This is the photographic index: a trace of the real, like a footprint or a death mask.

A diffusion model produces no such trace. It generates images from statistical patterns. Nothing was "there." No light hit a sensor. The image is a synthesis, not a recording.

The naive conclusion is that AI-generated images have no documentary value. The more productive conclusion is that the documentary value now lives elsewhere -- not in the single image, but in the process, the dataset, the system that produced it.

When I feed real archival photographs into a diffusion model and generate hybridized outputs, the resulting images are not documents. But the process is documentary: real materials enter a system, the system transforms them according to its biases and patterns, and what comes out reveals something about both the source material and the system. The document is the transformation itself.

### Beyond observation

Classical documentary modes -- observational, participatory, expository -- all assume a camera pointed at the world. Post-documentary doesn't abandon the camera, but it adds other instruments.

**Farocki's operational images.** Images made by machines for machines, never intended for human eyes. Surveillance feeds, targeting systems, quality control cameras. Farocki showed that these images are documents of a different kind: they document the operations of power, not the appearance of the world. AI-generated images extend this logic. They document the operations of models -- what a model "sees" when it processes an archive, what it prioritizes, what it distorts.

**Marker's essay film.** *Sans Soleil*, *Level Five*: images as thought, not evidence. The essay film treats images as material for reflection rather than proof of events. Post-documentary with AI inherits this: the generated image is not evidence that something happened, but material for thinking about how events are represented, remembered, and reconfigured.

**Forensic Architecture's spatial reconstruction.** Investigation as aesthetic practice. They reconstruct events from traces -- satellite images, witness testimonies, sound analysis, architectural models. The reconstruction is not the event. It's a synthetic image built from real evidence. Post-documentary with AI does something similar: it builds synthetic images from real materials, and the gap between the source and the synthesis is where meaning lives.

**Steyerl's poor images.** Low-resolution, compressed, circulated, degraded. Steyerl argued that the poor image is the image of our time -- not despite its degradation but because of it. The poor image carries the traces of its circulation, its copying, its compression. AI-generated images carry a different kind of trace: the statistical average of the dataset, the biases of the training, the artifacts of the generation process. These traces are the new form of "poverty" -- not resolution loss but information compression. Every AI image is a poor image in Steyerl's sense: it's the residue of a massive process of accumulation and reduction. (This connects to [post-internet aesthetics and post-photography](post-photography.md) more broadly.)

### What I do

My films start from real events. Real people. Real archives. Real consequences.

*Swatted* starts from real cases of swatting -- people attacked by armed police because someone called in a fake emergency. The film uses footage captured inside *Grand Theft Auto V* as documentary material. Not as illustration, not as metaphor -- as document. The virtual world is where these communities exist. The game footage is the most accurate representation of their reality.

*Maalbeek* starts from a real event -- the 2016 Brussels metro bombing. The film uses deepfake technology to place my face onto archival footage. Not to deceive, but to explore what it means to have been there, to have survived, to inhabit the images of a trauma that is simultaneously personal and mediated.

*Rewild* starts from real ecological transformation -- the return of wild animals to abandoned spaces. The installation processes documentary images of these spaces through diffusion models, generating hybridized landscapes that are neither the original document nor a fiction, but something between: a speculative document of a world in transformation.

In each case, the real is the starting point. The AI reconfigures it. The result is a post-documentary image: an image that acknowledges both its origin in reality and its passage through a synthetic process. It doesn't pretend to be a transparent record. It doesn't pretend to be pure fiction. It occupies the space between -- and that space is where post-documentary cinema lives. (This connects to the concept of [verbatim cinema](verbatim.md) -- reconstruction from real traces that produces something neither true nor false.)

### Post-documentary is not anti-documentary

This is important. Post-documentary doesn't reject documentary's commitment to the real. It extends it.

The real is still there. The people are real. The events happened. The archives exist. The consequences are material. Nothing about AI changes any of that.

What changes is the status of the image. In classical documentary, the image is evidence: I was there, I filmed this, here is what it looked like. In post-documentary, the image is a processed trace: this material existed, it passed through a system, and what you're seeing is the result of that passage. The honesty shifts from "this is what happened" to "this is what happens when we process what happened."

This shift doesn't weaken the documentary claim. If anything, it makes it more honest. Classical documentary always edited, selected, framed, narrated -- it always processed reality, just through analog means. Post-documentary makes the processing visible. The AI transformation is explicit, not hidden. The viewer knows they're seeing something that has been altered, and that knowledge is part of the experience.

The alternative -- pretending that documentary images are transparent, that the camera simply records what's there -- has always been a fiction. Post-documentary drops that fiction and works with the real on different terms.

### The reconfigured real

Reconfiguration is the key word. Not simulation (creating a fake reality), not documentation (recording an existing one), not illustration (making pictures of ideas). Reconfiguration: taking real materials and running them through a process that produces new configurations -- new arrangements of the same elements, revealing patterns and connections that the raw material couldn't show.

AI is particularly suited to reconfiguration because it operates on pattern recognition. When a diffusion model processes a documentary archive, it finds visual patterns across the corpus -- recurring forms, shared textures, structural similarities between images that might span decades or continents. The reconfigured output makes these patterns visible.

This is not abstraction. The specific, the particular, the individual remain at the center. But they're seen through the statistical lens of the model -- through the accumulated visual history of everything the model has learned. The particular meets the general, and the collision produces something neither one could produce alone. (This process is what I describe as [liquid writing](ecritures-liquides.md) -- the simultaneous flow between research, image-making, and tool-building.)
